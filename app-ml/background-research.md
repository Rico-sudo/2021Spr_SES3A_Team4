# Background Research & Considerations

## Why we want to solve this problem

Snake bites are a significant issue around the world, causing 100k deaths and 400k victims of disability and disfigurement per year. Rural communities in subdeveloped countries are the hardest hit as they have the highest venomous snake diversity and have limited medical expertise and access to antivenoms.

In order for antivenoms to be effective and save lives, it depends on the correct identification of the species of the biting snake. Snake identification is also important for improving understanding of snake distribution and diversity in certain areas.

Without a machine learning app - snake identification is difficult due to:
- High diversity
- Incomplete information from snakebite victims
- Lack of knowledge or resources by medical professionals in certain areas

This project aims to expore how Machine Learning can be applied to snake identification in order to minimise erroneous and delayed medical actions and improve snakebite data.

## Existing solutions

Critterpedia is currently the only existing solution - however it is still in beta so we cannot access the app.
Databases used for classification are not specified or publically available.
